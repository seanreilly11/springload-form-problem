# Springload Form Validation Problem

This is a coding problem created by Springload for their new developers to complete.

I have developed this using React, Typescript and Material UI.

## Steps to see program

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm init` or `yarn` depending on your package manager to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` and that will run the code
